## Installation

1. Go to Kajabi Admin Settings -> Checkout Settings
2. Go to the Checkout Footer Code box andcope-paste this code:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/osi4kjb-stripe-add-billing-address/dist/saba.min.js"></script>
```

It is strongly advised to use the script from the CDN because it is automatically updated when the Kajabi checkout script changes.
